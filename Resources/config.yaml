# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Pointer modes
#
# Your pointer's functionality changes depending
# on what mode it is in.
# 
# The keyboard will also inherit the color of the
# pointer and change its mode.
#
#  | Color    | Click   | Keyboard              |
#  | -------------------------------------------|
#  | Blue     | Left    | Main Layout           |
#  | Orange   | Right   | Main Layout + Shift   |
#  | Purple   | Middle  | Alt layout            |

# You may type using both hands. When having both
# pointers on the keyboard at the same time, by
# default the right hand's color will take precedence
# when deciding the mode of the keyboard. You may 
# change this here:

## "Left" or "Right"
primary_hand: Right

## "Left" or "Right"
watch_hand: Left

# The color of the pointer can be set 2 ways:
# - modifier bindings ("ClickModifierRight" and "ClickModifierMiddle")
# - hand orientation

# If you have capacitive buttons, I recommend binding the
# click modifiers to the touch actions of those.
# When touching both, right click takes precedence.

# If you do not have enough buttons to bind modifiers,
# you can also use the hand orientation to set mode.
# Bindings always take precedence over orientation.

## Use backhand-upward orientation for right click mode 
right_click_orientation: false

## Use palm-upwards orientation for middle click mode
middle_click_orientation: false

## Seconds to freeze the cursor for after clicking.
## Aims to help with double clicking.
click_freeze_time: 0.3

## Expose OpenVR input data to external applications
## Key is: "{Left|Right}.{ActionName}", action name is case sensitive input name defined in actions.json
## Value is a file that will be written with the value on every frame (recommend tmpfs)
## Types of Single, Vector1, Vector2 and Vector3 are all exported as Vector3, with the missing values set to 0.
# export_inputs:
#  Right.Scroll: /dev/shm/wlxoverlay_scroll_r
