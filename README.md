# WlxOverlay
A lightweight OpenVR overlay for Wayland and X11 desktops, inspired by XSOverlay.

Primarily made this because I couldn't find a proper desktop overlay for Linux.

Formerly known as X11Overlay

For the newer version that supports both SteamVR and Monado, see [WlxOverlay S](https://github.com/galister/wlx-overlay-s).

Features:
- Access your screens from within OpenVR / SteamVR
- Works with a huge variety of setups, including tiling window managers.
- Mouse pointer that supports left/right/middle click
- Customizable keyboard with 2-hand typing
- Watch panel that shows:
  - Local time + 2 customizable time zones
  - Battery states of SteamVR controllers + all connected trackers 
  - Volume rocker (customizable)
  - Toggles for screens / keyboard
- Notifications system with support for VRCX and Dbus (Desktop) notifications

# Known Issues
- Dragging curved displays very close may make them disappear. Long click the toggle on the watch to force respawn.
- Wayland: It's possible that your compositor does not implement some of the required protocols. Please create a ticket to let us know in that case.
- Wayland: screencopy can crash, especially with multiple screens up. this is being investigated, recommend wrapping in a restart loop for practical use in the meantime.
